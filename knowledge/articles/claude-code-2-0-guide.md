Sankalp's comprehensive guide to Claude Code 2.0 provides a deep technical dive into how to master modern coding agents. Published under the byline @dejavucoder, the article combines practical experience with Claude Code 2.0 and theoretical understanding of how to design prompts and workflows for maximum productivity.

The guide captures the shift in capabilities and workflows that occurred in the second half of 2025, making it essential reading for anyone seriously adopting AI-assisted coding.

## Core Topics Covered

### Claude Code 2.0 Features
- Advanced capabilities comparison with prior versions
- Feature breakdown and practical applications
- Integration with Opus 4.5 model

### Context Engineering
- Designing context for optimal agent performance
- Managing token budgets effectively
- Structuring information for agent comprehension

### Sub-Agents
- Multi-agent architectures and orchestration
- Delegation patterns for complex tasks
- Agent composition strategies

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers
- Setting up MCP integrations
- Custom MCP server development
- Tools and integrations available

### Hooks & Skills
- Custom hook development
- Skill definition and management
- Extending agent capabilities

### Advanced Techniques
- State management across sessions
- Context caching strategies
- Optimization for specific workflows

## Key Insights

The article emphasizes that effective agent usage is not about asking the "right question" once, but about:

1. **Structured context design** - Information architecture matters more than raw prompt engineering
2. **Iterative improvement** - Learning from agent behavior patterns
3. **Tool integration** - Leveraging MCP servers and custom tools effectively
4. **Workflow adaptation** - Changing how you work, not just what tools you use

## H2 2025 Context

Sankalp's analysis of the capability shift in the second half of 2025 is particularly valuable. The article documents:

- Rapid capability improvements in Claude Code and Codex
- Evolution of best practices based on community experience
