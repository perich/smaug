"Compound Engineering" is Every.to's definitive guide to how software teams can completely reimagine their engineering process when using AI agents like Claude Code and Codex. Rather than asking "how do we use AI in coding?" they ask "how do we engineer software when we're not writing code?"

Published by Dan Shipper and Kieran Klaassen, the article documents Every.to's own methodology - developed through real product work - and presents it as a replicable four-step engineering process.

## Four-Step Engineering Process

Every.to's compound engineering methodology involves a structured approach to working with AI agents that goes beyond simple prompt engineering. The process accounts for:

1. **Planning & Context** - Proper setup before agent execution
2. **Execution & Iteration** - Agent-assisted development cycles
3. **Review & Refinement** - Human validation and adjustment
4. **Integration & Deployment** - Getting code into production

## Key Concepts

### "Compound" Engineering
The term "compound" reflects the multiplicative effect of well-designed processes with AI agents. Just as compound interest creates exponential returns, compound engineering processes create exponential productivity gains.

### Rails-Specific Optimization
The methodology is particularly well-suited for Rails projects, where the framework's conventions align well with agent capabilities.

### Team Workflow Transformation
- No longer about how individuals write code faster
- Focus shifts to how teams architect solutions for agents
- Different skill set required from traditional software engineers

## Context

Published December 11, 2025 (updated January 5, 2026), this article came during the period when many organizations were beginning to adopt Claude Code and similar tools. Every.to's perspective is valuable because it's based on actual product work, not theoretical exploration.

The article has become a reference point for teams trying to understand how to fundamentally restructure their engineering practices around AI agents.

## Notable Commentary

From @moreconfetti: "@every has developed one of the best engineering toolkits for @claudeai (especially useful for my Rails projects) and @danshipper is a must follow for AI thought leadership in 2026"

## Relevance to Development Community

This article represents the shift from "how do I use an AI agent?" to "how do I build software engineering teams around AI agents?" It's particularly important for:

- Teams adopting Claude Code for production work
- Organizations restructuring around AI-first development
- Rails developers seeking structured agent workflows
- Product teams trying to understand new engineering paradigms
