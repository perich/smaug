"Shipping at Inference-Speed" is Peter Steinberger's exploration of how AI agents like Claude Code and Codex fundamentally change software development workflows. The article documents the shift from reading code to watching it stream by in real-time.

Steipete shares practical insights on optimizing agent configurations and prompts to maximize development velocity. His agents.md configuration from the agent-scripts repository has become a reference implementation for developers looking to dramatically improve agent performance.

## Key Insights

### Performance Impact
- **Tasks reduced from 2-5 minutes to under 1 minute** when using optimized agents configuration
- The "telegraph style" structured prompting approach accelerates agent execution
- Configuration matters more than base model capabilities

### Optimized Agents Configuration
- Available in agent-scripts repository
- Focused on concise, directive prompts
- Motivational context can improve performance
- Less is more - simpler instructions lead to faster execution

### Workflow Philosophy
- Stop reading code, start watching it stream
- Inference speed becomes the bottleneck
- Iteration cycles measured in seconds, not minutes
- Agent configuration directly impacts shipping speed

## Notable Quotes

From related tweets: "Smaller tasks that used to take 2-5 mins is now always under 1 min. Maybe the telegraph style makes it faster?"

## Context

Peter Steinberger's work on agent optimization has influenced the broader community discussion about effective agent use. His emphasis on telegraph-style (concise, structured) prompting contrasts with the tendency toward over-engineered agent files that actually slow down execution.

This article was published December 28, 2025, during the period when many developers were exploring new agent tools over the holidays.

## Impact

This article contributed to a broader community shift in 2025 toward understanding that agent speed optimization is primarily about workflow and prompt design, not about raw model capability. The practical results - 4-5x faster execution - make it a key reference point for developers adopting Claude Code and Codex.
