Repogrep (repogrep.com) is an ultra-fast codebase search engine for any public GitHub repository. It enables developers to quickly discover and understand code across the open-source ecosystem without cloning repositories locally.

The tool excels at rapid code discovery, making it valuable for understanding how specific libraries implement features (e.g., finding React hooks implementation in <10 seconds) or researching patterns across projects.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Search**: Searches public GitHub repositories with sub-10-second response times
- **No Local Clone Required**: Instant access to code without downloading repositories
- **Code-Specific Search**: Optimized for finding actual implementation code vs. documentation or issues
- **Public Repository Coverage**: Supports any public GitHub repository

## Use Cases

- **Code Learning**: Quickly find and study how popular libraries implement features
- **Pattern Research**: Discover how specific patterns or algorithms are implemented across projects
- **API Documentation**: Find real-world usage examples in open-source code
- **Technical Due Diligence**: Quickly assess code quality and patterns in dependencies
- **Competitive Analysis**: Understand how other projects solve similar problems

## Example Use

Finding React hooks source code in under 10 seconds, as demonstrated in the original tweet.

## Developer Workflow Integration

Ideal for:
- Code interviews and technical preparation
- Learning from established codebases
- Rapid prototyping by reference
- Understanding third-party library internals
