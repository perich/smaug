OpenProse is a programming language designed for AI sessions that treats them as Turing-complete computers. It enables complex agent orchestration and multi-agent workflows through a declarative syntax without requiring code, frameworks, or external dependencies.

Unlike traditional software frameworks, OpenProse operates as a skill that integrates directly into existing coding harnesses (Claude Code, Opencode, Amp, Codex) and uses natural language-like syntax to define agent interactions, parallel execution, and control flow.

## Key Features

- **No Code Required** - Define workflows using structured English/declarative syntax
- **No Dependencies** - Works as a pure prompt without external frameworks or libraries
- **Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate multiple agents with parallel execution, conditionals, and loops
- **Turing-Complete** - Capable of arbitrarily complex computation and control flow
- **Multi-Platform** - Works with Claude Code, Opencode, Amp, and Codex
- **Built-in Onboarding** - Self-contained setup process with guided learning
- **Skill-Based Installation** - Installs as a skill/plugin without affecting host system

## Syntax Concepts

- **Agent Definition** - Declare agents with specific models and capabilities
- **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple agents simultaneously using `parallel` blocks
- **Conditional Loops** - Iterate until conditions are met with `loop until` syntax
- **Session Context** - Pass context and outputs between agent sessions
- **Skills Management** - Agents can be assigned specific skills like web-search

## Technical Details

- **Language:** OpenProse (domain-specific language)
- **Repository:** github.com/openprose/prose
- **Architecture:** Transforms natural language specifications into Turing-complete execution within AI sessions
- **Installation:** Skill-based, no dependencies to install
- **Platforms:** Any coding harness supporting skills (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

## Use Cases

- Research and writing workflows combining multiple specialized agents
- Data analysis pipelines with sequential processing steps
- Multi-agent code generation with review and refinement loops
- Complex orchestration that doesn't require traditional programming
- Workflows that benefit from LLM reasoning at each step

## Significance

OpenProse represents a paradigm shift in how AI developers approach agent orchestration. By treating the AI session itself as the runtime and removing the need for code or frameworks, it dramatically lowers the barrier to creating sophisticated multi-agent systems. This aligns with the philosophy of AI-native development where the models themselves become the primary development interface.
