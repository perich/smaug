**Parent Tweet:** @Rainmaker1973 - New researsh shows ice is slippery because of electrical charges — not pressure and friction.

For almost 200 years, the prevailing explanation for ice's slipperiness was that friction or pressure from a skate, boot, or tire melted a microscopic film of water on the surface, creating a lubricating layer. A new study from Saarland University has overturned that long-standing idea.

Instead, the true cause lies in the electric fields generated by molecular dipoles. When any object contacts ice, the partial charges in its own molecules interact with the highly ordered dipole arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal. This electrostatic tug-of-war loosens the topmost layer of the ice lattice, transforming it into a thin, disordered, quasi-liquid film—without any need for heat or significant pressure.

Remarkably, this self-lubrication mechanism works even at temperatures approaching absolute zero, where thermal energy is virtually absent and conventional pressure-melting or frictional heating theories completely break down. In those extreme conditions, ice remains slippery simply because its surface molecules are electrically vulnerable.

- **What:** Siqi Chen signals confidence in Google by rotating a significant portfolio position from NVIDIA to Google, timed around Gemini 3's emergence as a frontier AI model.

## @VictorTaelin - Comprehensive analysis: Gemini 3 capabilities and limitations
> My notes on Gemini 3
>
> # Short Version:
>
> First of all: you've all seen the benchmarks, so I don't think you need me to judge this one. Still, based on my tests, this is as real as it gets, and I want to talk about it. This model outperforms GPT-5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, and everything else, on my hardest problems, by far.
>
> It is the new SOTA at:
> → debugging complex compiler bugs
> → refactoring files without logical mistakes
> → solving difficult λ-calculus problems
> → ASCII art (it is almost decent now!)
> → Competitive Gen 3 OU (won't elaborate 😭)
>
> It is still an LLM, though. It has similar failure modes, and is worse than Sonnet / GPT-5 in some scenarios.
>
> It seems very bad at:
> → inferring intent
> → not going overboard
> → one-shot vibe coding
> → creative writing
> → health questions
>
> Also, I suspect this checkpoint isn't the best Google has.
>
> Now, on to a complete, manually typed Gemini 3 overview.
>
> ---
>
> # Long Version
>
> 1. Vibe Test: λ-Calculus Programming
>
> I like this vibe test because it is cheat proof: as soon as a model solves my hardest problem, I just create a harder one, moving the goalpost a little bit.
>
> Current track record:
> → n-tuple-map: solved by Grok 3 (Feb 2025)
> → n-tuple-fold: solved by GPT-5 (Aug 2025)
> → n-tuple-rotl: solved by Gemini 3 (today!)
>
> Implementing rotl is impressive, because:
> → no other model gets even close to solving it
> → Gemini's solution is 2x simpler than my own's
> → Gemini 3 solved it 5x faster than myself
>
> In fact, its solution is so short, it fits a single line:
>
> λn.λt.λk.(tλx.(nλg.λh.(h(gλq.λr.λs.(q(r s))))λu.λf.(f x)λu.u k))
>
> Pretty, isn't it? This minuscule function is a generic rotator for λ-encoded tuples. For a comparison, every other model creates a 5x larger term... that doesn't work. Nothing else creates anything like that, at all. That answer was a jaw-dropping moment for me.
>
> I'll post a Gist with the prompt, and a runnable solution.
>
> 2. Real-World Debugging
>
> A few weeks ago, I was stuck in a tough HVM4 bug. I posted about it here, lamenting that no AI could solve it. Well, turns out, an AI did solve it. Someone managed to run my prompt on an old checkpoint via LMSys, and it nailed the issue: a stack underflow on a specific optimization. The solution was simple: replace `WNF_SPOS < 0` by `WNF_SPOS < spos`.
>
> This was the first time an AI solved a real problem before I could solve it myself, and that let me move on to the next thing, leading to great progress.
>
> I now tested Gemini 3 on many old debugging prompts, and it solved half of them. Bugs that took me hours are now solved by a computer in a minute!
>
> Now, and sadly: I've sent the stack underflow issue to the Gemini 3 model that launched today, and it failed to spot the culprit. So, either this model is not the smartest variant Google has, or I was really lucky that day. ):
>
> 3. Real-World Coding / Refactoring
>
> This model is great at writing large files with no mistakes.
>
> For example, I've asked some AIs to rewrite HVM4.hs with a few core changes. I then inspected the trickiest functions. As you'd expect, all models failed on important details that lead to serious bugs - except for Gemini 3, which nailed it.
>
> This is particularly encouraging to me, since models struggled with niche restrictions like linearity, making them unusable for core HVM functions. Gemini 3 seems extremely competent at it.
>
> (Code in the image below.)
>
> 4. Problems and Quirks
>
> I've asked Gemini 3 to one shot a web app, and it did poorly. GPT-5.1 (high) gave me complete file, with everything I asked for, zero bugs. Gemini 3 gave me a 3x smaller file, with tons of missing features and many bugs. I couldn't get Gemini 3 to one shot a file nearly as good as the one by GPT-5.1.
>
> I've also sent it my pre-meningitis prompt, and it completely discarded meningitis (💀). Not sure I'd trust it for health issues.
>
> I've asked it to write a story, and it was bad. No excuses.
>
> It will often go overboard and write full files instead of just patching holes.
>
> It seems slower than even GPT-5 (high) on Gemini CLI, although it is much faster when called directly?
>
> Lastly, and funnily, it struggles to produce incorrect code when context calls for it. For example, if your type has a generic "Show" instance, and you ask it to build a custom one, it will often struggle, because that'd technically be an error. It can't grasp that you'd just remove the old one afterwards!

> While working on our own assistant, we realized the core driver of this problem is a human one: People don't know everything they need to say upfront, for every action you could do on the internet. And to solve it, we would need to think about how to marry design and technology in a new way.
>
> AI Autocomplete solves this, and can now plug into chat interfaces to guide you in real-time, with everything you would need to say, upfront. So you can do anything you can do on the internet in one shot. No more back and forth.
>
> As a result, this unlocks multiple AI breakthroughs:
> 1. 10x faster search and commerce
> 2. Smarter (and far lower cost) media generation
> 3. Natural language advertising
> 4. Powerful, lightweight Augmented Reality
>
> From here, we'll be using this for Hero, but we also want others to use it too since this is an industry-wide problem. So if you have a product that could benefit from AI Autocomplete and want to work with us, reach out below!
>
> Shoutout to @seunglee1b who helped think of and patent this nearly 3 years ago! And shoutout to the entire @hero_assistant team that keeps innovating on the next generation of AI products

## @kieranklaassen - Token Efficiency in Agent Design with MCP
> Your agent connects to 50 MCP servers with 1,000 tools. It loads every tool definition into context before reading your request. Then it passes a 10,000-row spreadsheet through the model twice to copy data between tools.
>
> You just burned 150,000 tokens on overhead.
>
> Code execution with MCP solves this: agents write code to call tools, loading definitions on-demand and filtering data in the execution environment. Same task, 2,000 tokens—98.7% reduction.

## @glcst - SQLite Database for AI Agent State Management
> Time and time again we hear from agent builders that they want a database that looks like a filesystem. Where they can store files locally, agent state, tool call state, and basic local observability.
>
> Obviously SQLite is the perfect shape for this. But a higher level of abstraction helps.
>
> I told Pekka not to worry about this now. Which of course means he just started hacking on it anyway, and as usual, it is looking very awesome!

**Quoted context:**
> @penberg: "SQLite is the perfect database for AI agents—but nobody knows how to use it. Many agent developers I've talked to make the same point: SQLite is ideal for capturing agent state, handling auditing, ensuring compliance, and managing snapshots. It's lightweight, all data represented in one single file. But when I ask them what the interface should look like, nobody can really answer. What should the schema look like? How do we make it work across different agent frameworks? How do we handle the filesystem transparently?
>
> After some iteration and conversations with folks building agents, I've identified the three missing pieces:
>
> 1. A standardized schema specification. We need a common way to represent agent state, actions, and outcomes. This isn't just about storing data—it's about enabling an ecosystem of tooling. When everyone uses the same schema, we can build debugging tools, replay systems, and compliance analyzers.
>
> 2. A programmatic SDK. Raw SQL obviously isn't enough. Developers need type-safe APIs, automatic migrations, and framework integrations. The SDK should feel native whether you're using a framework or rolling your own agent system.
>
> 3. A transparent filesystem layer. People building agent compute infrastructure actually want a transparent agent filesystem that works with bash, curl, and friends. Agents shouldn't have to think about where their data lives. They just read and write files, and our system handles the rest.
>
> That why me and @glcst at @tursodatabase have been hacking on AgentFS (https://t.co/qESfjwjC36)—a specification and implementation for agent state management. If you're building agents and fighting with state management, I'd love to hear from you. And if you want to help shape this standard, check out the repo and join the discussion."
