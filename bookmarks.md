## ## @thenarrator - Why Prediction Markets Force Accountability Into Beliefs
> this is one of the clearest explanations of why prediction markets matter that I've seen.

Vitalik is basically saying:

> prediction markets aren't about gambling, they're about forcing accountability into beliefs.

> on social media, people get rewarded for being loud, extreme, and wrong.

whereas on prediction markets, you get punished for being wrong  and that flips incentives completely.

> what's powerful here is the idea that markets discipline narratives.

you can scream "this will definitely happen" on X and get likes, but the moment you have to put money behind it, uncertainty suddenly matters.

that's why prediction markets feel healthier than most info ecosystems:

> lies are costly
> confidence has a price
> reality settles arguments

they don't eliminate misinformation, but they price and that alone makes them one of the most honest coordination tools we've ever built.

## ## @irl_danB - Context Windows and Agent Architecture
> context window won't be "solved" as long as attention is quadratic

and presumably Suhail is thinking about the compaction problem as it occurs in long running agents like claude code

but this is downstream from an architectural problem with standard agent implementations (claude code among them) that use a linear "chat-like" history

we all work through coding tasks linearly, but any seasoned software engineer's mental model of their progress looks more like a call stack: pushing tasks on and popping them off when complete

when the claude code harness organizes the context more like a call stack (think flame graph) than a linear chat log, compaction will not even be necessary in many cases and less lossy in the cases where it is

for the familiar, think: loom

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356
- **What:** Technical analysis of how context window limitations in AI systems are fundamentally tied to quadratic attention complexity, and proposing a call-stack-based architecture instead of linear chat histories could better model how developers actually think through problems.

## @Altimor - Civilization vs. Violence First Principles
> This was one of my top philosophical realizations this year and biggest break with libertarianism: the realization that the laws of civilization aren't first principles; that the only first principles are that of violence (which are straightforwardly derived from the laws of physics); and that "you can't let your ideals for what ought to happen inside a civilization come before what it takes to have a civilization in the first place" (grateful to @Devon_Eriksen_ for sparking the insight).

## @hsu_steve - AI-Assisted Quantum Field Theory Research
> I think I've published the first research article in theoretical physics in which the main idea came from an AI - GPT5 in this case. The physics research paper itself (on QFT and state-dependent quantum mechanics) has been published in Physics Letters B.
>
> I've written an accompanying AI paper describing the Generator - Verifier method I used to obtain useful research results from frontier LLMs. It may be of interest to other physicists and to AI researchers.
>
> From the AI paper:
>
> ... models sometimes make very simple mistakes (e.g. in calculation) and also even make incorrect conceptual leaps that are superficially plausible. The second type of error can lead even expert researchers astray, consuming large amounts of effort to detect and correct. Research with an LLM might be compared to collaboration with a brilliant but unreliable human genius who is capable of deep insights but also of errors both simple and profound.
>
> Fortunately, both types of errors can be strongly suppressed by using structured orchestration of multiple model instances, greatly improving reliability. A Generate - Verify protocol, in which one model produces a step forward and another model instance independently checks it, reduces hallucination errors significantly compared to single-pass generation. ...
>
> The physics paper (abstract below) derives new operator integrability conditions required for foliation independence (necessary for integrability of quantum field theory; cf Tomonaga-Schwinger) that are very difficult to satisfy in any modifcation of quantum mechanics that is "state dependent" - i.e., deviates from linear Schrodinger evolution.

## @tobi - LLM-Driven Language Cross-Compilation with Agent Specs
> Fun weekend project:
>
> I ported try from Ruby to C as a challenge to agentic workflows.
>
> Steps:
> 1. Extract a directory of spec files for all features of try
> 2. Create automated tests for each spec, executing against the Ruby reference implementation
> 3. Teach the agent to refer to the written specs when a test fails
> 4. Set up an empty directory with basic C libraries (zstr.h, zvec.h- thanks @zuhaitz_dev)
> 5. Instruct Claude to write the C code using those libraries and not stop until all specs pass
>
> Took a bit of fine-tuning, but now I have matching Ruby and C versions. I can add features to both just by updating the spec. It also successfully generated experimental Go and Zig versions.
>
> Published the C version with proper releases: https://github.com/tobi/try-cli
>
> Also packaged it in AUR. Arch users can just run `yay -S try-cli`

## @robbystarbuck - Immigration and national security concerns

>
> *Quoting @ProjectConstitu:* 🚨 ALERT: Afghan National Involved in Fairfax Police Shooting Linked to Recent DC Incident Involving National Guard Members
>
> Yesterday, November 26, two National Guard members—Pfc. Andrew Wolfe, 24, and Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20—were critically injured in a shooting near the White House in Washington, DC. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021, reportedly drove from across the country before the incident. Both service members, who had just been sworn in less than 24 hours prior as part of enhanced security measures under President Trump, are receiving medical treatment.
>
> Looking back to April 23 in Fairfax, VA: A routine traffic stop escalated when Jamal Wali, 36, another Afghan national, expressed frustration and mentioned the Taliban before firing at officers. One bullet injured two officers in their arms, but they were treated and released. Wali was fatally shot in the exchange. Body camera footage captured the event, showing his anger toward the U.S.
>
> These incidents raise questions about vetting processes. Both individuals entered the U.S. under programs from the Obama and Biden administrations—Wali in 2014 as a translator, and Lakanwal through asylum pathways amid the Afghanistan withdrawal. Concerns have been voiced about border security and immigration policies that may have allowed unvetted entries.
>
> President Trump is addressing this by deploying 500 additional Guardsmen, but many are calling for stronger measures to secure the border. Share if you support accountability and safer policies!

## @iamsahaj_xyz - Agent-Assisted Development Workflow
> recent workflow I've started to adopt:

step 1
- ask agent to implement something.
- test if it works

loop this until you get a working version

step 2
in a new chat, in plan mode, ask the agent to check the current diff with main branch and refactor the changes
- as if it was being written from scratch,
- goal is to minimize tech debt,
- don't aim for the shortest way possible

step 3
iterate on plan and let it rip when you're happy.

tbf this is nothing new, this is also how most people work regardless of the agent being there, just observed myself doing this more often recently

## @notnotstorm - Running 24x Claude Code Instances Workflow
> when running 24x claude code instances makes sense:

1. an initial agent scanned my repo looking for general improvements. it flagged 20 things. I liked 12 of them and told it to create a github issue for each

2. I opened up 12 tmux panes and ran `/fix <issue_number>` in each one. this is a slash command that fixes a gh issue in a new worktree and submits a pr

3. I split each of those panes in half and ran `/review <pr_number>` on each of the 12 prs

4. I ran `/respond` in each of the 12 original panes, to respond to the reviews and update the pr's with any necessary fixes

5. I ran `/summarize_prs` to figure out the best merge order and flag PR's that might have bad concerns or tradeoffs

next step is decide which PR's I want to merge and merge them

it's still a very manual process but every week I feel like I'm getting a lot faster

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/notnotstorm/status/1993443281846649209

## @badlogicgames - Slack Bot Coding Agent with Docker Isolation
> Ok, I think this is going somewhere! Built a Slack bot that's basically a coding agent which has:

> 2. File read/write/edit tools
> 3. Bash
>
> Bash tool operates inside a Docker container, into which channel history JSONL and channel attachments are mounted.
>
> Bot can do whatever it wants inside the Docker container. Install tools like GH CLI, Node, Python, etc, clone repositories, compile stuff, fetch stuff from the web.
>
> Bot is invoked by mentioning it in the channel, which will trigger an agentic run. Bot posts a message to the slack channel, which gets updated with new outputs from the agent run. For debugging, a thread is attached to the message, which shows all tool invocations chronologically.
>
> And it has a tool that lets it attach one or more files from the Docker container to its Slack message. So it can create stuff for me in the container, and ship the result as a plain old Slack attachment. Very nice!
>
> This is super nice to work with. And through the Docker isolation, I might actually not shoot myself in the foot.

This is notable: Opus 4.5 is ~60% more expensive than Sonnet ($25/million output compared to $15/million) but if it can use 76% fewer output reasoning tokens for the same complex task it may end up cheaper!

Actually surprisingly, codex max xhigh decently on repo bench, but not as good as vanilla 5.1 low. It's not on the leaderboard, but it's in the explorer. I would say, for coding intelligence, more reasoning is better, but that's also why I split planning / discovery, from execution. Execution needs less reasoning

## @transitive_bs - Feynman Discusses Why Simple Things Are Complex
> @Rainmaker1973 amazing convo from feynman discussing why \"simple\" things like this are so complex under the hood https://t.co/fEv7bgXqeX

**Parent Tweet:** @Rainmaker1973 - New researsh shows ice is slippery because of electrical charges — not pressure and friction.

For almost 200 years, the prevailing explanation for ice's slipperiness was that friction or pressure from a skate, boot, or tire melted a microscopic film of water on the surface, creating a lubricating layer. A new study from Saarland University has overturned that long-standing idea.

Instead, the true cause lies in the electric fields generated by molecular dipoles. When any object contacts ice, the partial charges in its own molecules interact with the highly ordered dipole arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal. This electrostatic tug-of-war loosens the topmost layer of the ice lattice, transforming it into a thin, disordered, quasi-liquid film—without any need for heat or significant pressure.

Remarkably, this self-lubrication mechanism works even at temperatures approaching absolute zero, where thermal energy is virtually absent and conventional pressure-melting or frictional heating theories completely break down. In those extreme conditions, ice remains slippery simply because its surface molecules are electrically vulnerable.

- **What:** Travis Fischer shares a Feynman discussion about the surprising complexity of why ice is slippery, relating to new research about electrical charges and molecular dipoles rather than traditional pressure-melting theories.

## @blader - Market rotation from NVDA to GOOG on Gemini 3 emergence
> re: gemini 3
>
> for the past 4 years i've had the plurality of our liquid net worth in NVDA
>
> about a month ago i sold it all and rotated into GOOG
>
> take from that what you will

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/blader/status/1990958680456471005
- **What:** Siqi Chen signals confidence in Google by rotating a significant portfolio position from NVIDIA to Google, timed around Gemini 3's emergence as a frontier AI model.

## @VictorTaelin - Comprehensive analysis: Gemini 3 capabilities and limitations
> My notes on Gemini 3
>
> # Short Version:
>
> First of all: you've all seen the benchmarks, so I don't think you need me to judge this one. Still, based on my tests, this is as real as it gets, and I want to talk about it. This model outperforms GPT-5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, and everything else, on my hardest problems, by far.
>
> It is the new SOTA at:
> → debugging complex compiler bugs
> → refactoring files without logical mistakes
> → solving difficult λ-calculus problems
> → ASCII art (it is almost decent now!)
> → Competitive Gen 3 OU (won't elaborate 😭)
>
> It is still an LLM, though. It has similar failure modes, and is worse than Sonnet / GPT-5 in some scenarios.
>
> It seems very bad at:
> → inferring intent
> → not going overboard
> → one-shot vibe coding
> → creative writing
> → health questions
>
> Also, I suspect this checkpoint isn't the best Google has.
>
> Now, on to a complete, manually typed Gemini 3 overview.
>
> ---
>
> # Long Version
>
> 1. Vibe Test: λ-Calculus Programming
>
> I like this vibe test because it is cheat proof: as soon as a model solves my hardest problem, I just create a harder one, moving the goalpost a little bit.
>
> Current track record:
> → n-tuple-map: solved by Grok 3 (Feb 2025)
> → n-tuple-fold: solved by GPT-5 (Aug 2025)
> → n-tuple-rotl: solved by Gemini 3 (today!)
>
> Implementing rotl is impressive, because:
> → no other model gets even close to solving it
> → Gemini's solution is 2x simpler than my own's
> → Gemini 3 solved it 5x faster than myself
>
> In fact, its solution is so short, it fits a single line:
>
> λn.λt.λk.(tλx.(nλg.λh.(h(gλq.λr.λs.(q(r s))))λu.λf.(f x)λu.u k))
>
> Pretty, isn't it? This minuscule function is a generic rotator for λ-encoded tuples. For a comparison, every other model creates a 5x larger term... that doesn't work. Nothing else creates anything like that, at all. That answer was a jaw-dropping moment for me.
>
> I'll post a Gist with the prompt, and a runnable solution.
>
> 2. Real-World Debugging
>
> A few weeks ago, I was stuck in a tough HVM4 bug. I posted about it here, lamenting that no AI could solve it. Well, turns out, an AI did solve it. Someone managed to run my prompt on an old checkpoint via LMSys, and it nailed the issue: a stack underflow on a specific optimization. The solution was simple: replace `WNF_SPOS < 0` by `WNF_SPOS < spos`.
>
> This was the first time an AI solved a real problem before I could solve it myself, and that let me move on to the next thing, leading to great progress.
>
> I now tested Gemini 3 on many old debugging prompts, and it solved half of them. Bugs that took me hours are now solved by a computer in a minute!
>
> Now, and sadly: I've sent the stack underflow issue to the Gemini 3 model that launched today, and it failed to spot the culprit. So, either this model is not the smartest variant Google has, or I was really lucky that day. ):
>
> 3. Real-World Coding / Refactoring
>
> This model is great at writing large files with no mistakes.
>
> For example, I've asked some AIs to rewrite HVM4.hs with a few core changes. I then inspected the trickiest functions. As you'd expect, all models failed on important details that lead to serious bugs - except for Gemini 3, which nailed it.
>
> This is particularly encouraging to me, since models struggled with niche restrictions like linearity, making them unusable for core HVM functions. Gemini 3 seems extremely competent at it.
>
> (Code in the image below.)
>
> 4. Problems and Quirks
>
> I've asked Gemini 3 to one shot a web app, and it did poorly. GPT-5.1 (high) gave me complete file, with everything I asked for, zero bugs. Gemini 3 gave me a 3x smaller file, with tons of missing features and many bugs. I couldn't get Gemini 3 to one shot a file nearly as good as the one by GPT-5.1.
>
> I've also sent it my pre-meningitis prompt, and it completely discarded meningitis (💀). Not sure I'd trust it for health issues.
>
> I've asked it to write a story, and it was bad. No excuses.
>
> It will often go overboard and write full files instead of just patching holes.
>
> It seems slower than even GPT-5 (high) on Gemini CLI, although it is much faster when called directly?
>
> Lastly, and funnily, it struggles to produce incorrect code when context calls for it. For example, if your type has a generic "Show" instance, and you ask it to build a custom one, it will often struggle, because that'd technically be an error. It can't grasp that you'd just remove the old one afterwards!
>
> 5. Conclusion
>
> Enough typing, bye

## @mitsuhiko - AI discourse: Why JSON beats TOON for token efficiency
> AI discourse on Twitter is frustrating. Take this tweet with thousands of views. It claims you should  use TOON instead of JSON. But if you actually count tokens, the savings are … barely existing, it's not in the training data, and tabular JSON beats it. https://t.co/tD00NOS0mN https://t.co/vJe4zB407l

## @glcst - SQLite Database for AI Agent State Management
> Time and time again we hear from agent builders that they want a database that looks like a filesystem. Where they can store files locally, agent state, tool call state, and basic local observability.
>
> Obviously SQLite is the perfect shape for this. But a higher level of abstraction helps.
>
> I told Pekka not to worry about this now. Which of course means he just started hacking on it anyway, and as usual, it is looking very awesome!

**Quoted context:**
> @penberg: "SQLite is the perfect database for AI agents—but nobody knows how to use it. Many agent developers I've talked to make the same point: SQLite is ideal for capturing agent state, handling auditing, ensuring compliance, and managing snapshots. It's lightweight, all data represented in one single file. But when I ask them what the interface should look like, nobody can really answer. What should the schema look like? How do we make it work across different agent frameworks? How do we handle the filesystem transparently?
>
> After some iteration and conversations with folks building agents, I've identified the three missing pieces:
>
> 1. A standardized schema specification. We need a common way to represent agent state, actions, and outcomes. This isn't just about storing data—it's about enabling an ecosystem of tooling. When everyone uses the same schema, we can build debugging tools, replay systems, and compliance analyzers.
>
> 2. A programmatic SDK. Raw SQL obviously isn't enough. Developers need type-safe APIs, automatic migrations, and framework integrations. The SDK should feel native whether you're using a framework or rolling your own agent system.
>
> 3. A transparent filesystem layer. People building agent compute infrastructure actually want a transparent agent filesystem that works with bash, curl, and friends. Agents shouldn't have to think about where their data lives. They just read and write files, and our system handles the rest.
>
> That why me and @glcst at @tursodatabase have been hacking on AgentFS (https://t.co/qESfjwjC36)—a specification and implementation for agent state management. If you're building agents and fighting with state management, I'd love to hear from you. And if you want to help shape this standard, check out the repo and join the discussion."

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/glcst/status/1985788399488549254
- **What:** Discussion on SQLite's suitability for AI agent state management and the development of AgentFS as a standardized solution with schema specifications and SDK.

## @dystopiangf - Immigration and Societal Decline
