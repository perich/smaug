## @Altimor - Civilization vs. Violence First Principles
> This was one of my top philosophical realizations this year and biggest break with libertarianism: the realization that the laws of civilization aren't first principles; that the only first principles are that of violence (which are straightforwardly derived from the laws of physics); and that "you can't let your ideals for what ought to happen inside a civilization come before what it takes to have a civilization in the first place" (grateful to @Devon_Eriksen_ for sparking the insight).

## @hsu_steve - AI-Assisted Quantum Field Theory Research
> I think I've published the first research article in theoretical physics in which the main idea came from an AI - GPT5 in this case. The physics research paper itself (on QFT and state-dependent quantum mechanics) has been published in Physics Letters B.
>
> I've written an accompanying AI paper describing the Generator - Verifier method I used to obtain useful research results from frontier LLMs. It may be of interest to other physicists and to AI researchers.
>
> From the AI paper:
>
> ... models sometimes make very simple mistakes (e.g. in calculation) and also even make incorrect conceptual leaps that are superficially plausible. The second type of error can lead even expert researchers astray, consuming large amounts of effort to detect and correct. Research with an LLM might be compared to collaboration with a brilliant but unreliable human genius who is capable of deep insights but also of errors both simple and profound.
>
> Fortunately, both types of errors can be strongly suppressed by using structured orchestration of multiple model instances, greatly improving reliability. A Generate - Verify protocol, in which one model produces a step forward and another model instance independently checks it, reduces hallucination errors significantly compared to single-pass generation. ...
>
> The physics paper (abstract below) derives new operator integrability conditions required for foliation independence (necessary for integrability of quantum field theory; cf Tomonaga-Schwinger) that are very difficult to satisfy in any modifcation of quantum mechanics that is "state dependent" - i.e., deviates from linear Schrodinger evolution.
>
> Whether quantum evolution is EXACTLY linear is one of the most fundamental questions in all of science. It has implications for quantum computing and quantum foundations - i.e., whether we live in an Everettian multiverse!

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/hsu_steve/status/1996034522308026435
- **What:** First theoretical physics research article where the main contribution originated from GPT-5, published in Physics Letters B. Describes the Generator-Verifier orchestration method for reliably using frontier LLMs in physics research while mitigating hallucination and error risks.

## @tobi - LLM-Driven Language Cross-Compilation with Agent Specs
> Fun weekend project:
>
> I ported try from Ruby to C as a challenge to agentic workflows.
>
> Steps:
> 1. Extract a directory of spec files for all features of try
> 2. Create automated tests for each spec, executing against the Ruby reference implementation
> 3. Teach the agent to refer to the written specs when a test fails
> 4. Set up an empty directory with basic C libraries (zstr.h, zvec.h- thanks @zuhaitz_dev)
> 5. Instruct Claude to write the C code using those libraries and not stop until all specs pass
>
> Took a bit of fine-tuning, but now I have matching Ruby and C versions. I can add features to both just by updating the spec. It also successfully generated experimental Go and Zig versions.
>
> Published the C version with proper releases: https://github.com/tobi/try-cli
>
> Also packaged it in AUR. Arch users can just run `yay -S try-cli`
>
> This feels like a big part of the future: write once in a high-level language like Ruby, then LLM-compile to any low-level target. Developing high-quality specs like these is totally tractable for agents.

## @robbystarbuck - Immigration and national security concerns
> "Today's the day, you f*cking dumb*ss White people" is what he said right before shooting at the police. Importing people who hate your citizens is treason and should be treated as such. Just like the guy who shot the National Guard this week, this man never should've been here.
>
> *Quoting @ProjectConstitu:* 🚨 ALERT: Afghan National Involved in Fairfax Police Shooting Linked to Recent DC Incident Involving National Guard Members
>
> Yesterday, November 26, two National Guard members—Pfc. Andrew Wolfe, 24, and Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20—were critically injured in a shooting near the White House in Washington, DC. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021, reportedly drove from across the country before the incident. Both service members, who had just been sworn in less than 24 hours prior as part of enhanced security measures under President Trump, are receiving medical treatment.
>
> Looking back to April 23 in Fairfax, VA: A routine traffic stop escalated when Jamal Wali, 36, another Afghan national, expressed frustration and mentioned the Taliban before firing at officers. One bullet injured two officers in their arms, but they were treated and released. Wali was fatally shot in the exchange. Body camera footage captured the event, showing his anger toward the U.S.
>
> These incidents raise questions about vetting processes. Both individuals entered the U.S. under programs from the Obama and Biden administrations—Wali in 2014 as a translator, and Lakanwal through asylum pathways amid the Afghanistan withdrawal. Concerns have been voiced about border security and immigration policies that may have allowed unvetted entries.
>
> President Trump is addressing this by deploying 500 additional Guardsmen, but many are calling for stronger measures to secure the border. Share if you support accountability and safer policies!

## @iamsahaj_xyz - Agent-Assisted Development Workflow
> recent workflow I've started to adopt:

step 1
- ask agent to implement something.
- test if it works

loop this until you get a working version

step 2
in a new chat, in plan mode, ask the agent to check the current diff with main branch and refactor the changes
- as if it was being written from scratch,
- goal is to minimize tech debt,
- don't aim for the shortest way possible

step 3
iterate on plan and let it rip when you're happy.

tbf this is nothing new, this is also how most people work regardless of the agent being there, just observed myself doing this more often recently

## @notnotstorm - Running 24x Claude Code Instances Workflow
> when running 24x claude code instances makes sense:

1. an initial agent scanned my repo looking for general improvements. it flagged 20 things. I liked 12 of them and told it to create a github issue for each

2. I opened up 12 tmux panes and ran `/fix <issue_number>` in each one. this is a slash command that fixes a gh issue in a new worktree and submits a pr

3. I split each of those panes in half and ran `/review <pr_number>` on each of the 12 prs

4. I ran `/respond` in each of the 12 original panes, to respond to the reviews and update the pr's with any necessary fixes

5. I ran `/summarize_prs` to figure out the best merge order and flag PR's that might have bad concerns or tradeoffs

next step is decide which PR's I want to merge and merge them

it's still a very manual process but every week I feel like I'm getting a lot faster

> 3. Bash
>
> Bash tool operates inside a Docker container, into which channel history JSONL and channel attachments are mounted.
>
> Bot can do whatever it wants inside the Docker container. Install tools like GH CLI, Node, Python, etc, clone repositories, compile stuff, fetch stuff from the web.
>
> Bot is invoked by mentioning it in the channel, which will trigger an agentic run. Bot posts a message to the slack channel, which gets updated with new outputs from the agent run. For debugging, a thread is attached to the message, which shows all tool invocations chronologically.
>
> And it has a tool that lets it attach one or more files from the Docker container to its Slack message. So it can create stuff for me in the container, and ship the result as a plain old Slack attachment. Very nice!

Actually surprisingly, codex max xhigh decently on repo bench, but not as good as vanilla 5.1 low. It's not on the leaderboard, but it's in the explorer. I would say, for coding intelligence, more reasoning is better, but that's also why I split planning / discovery, from execution. Execution needs less reasoning

## @transitive_bs - Feynman Discusses Why Simple Things Are Complex
> @Rainmaker1973 amazing convo from feynman discussing why \"simple\" things like this are so complex under the hood https://t.co/fEv7bgXqeX

**Parent Tweet:** @Rainmaker1973 - New researsh shows ice is slippery because of electrical charges — not pressure and friction.

For almost 200 years, the prevailing explanation for ice's slipperiness was that friction or pressure from a skate, boot, or tire melted a microscopic film of water on the surface, creating a lubricating layer. A new study from Saarland University has overturned that long-standing idea.

Instead, the true cause lies in the electric fields generated by molecular dipoles. When any object contacts ice, the partial charges in its own molecules interact with the highly ordered dipole arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal. This electrostatic tug-of-war loosens the topmost layer of the ice lattice, transforming it into a thin, disordered, quasi-liquid film—without any need for heat or significant pressure.

Remarkably, this self-lubrication mechanism works even at temperatures approaching absolute zero, where thermal energy is virtually absent and conventional pressure-melting or frictional heating theories completely break down. In those extreme conditions, ice remains slippery simply because its surface molecules are electrically vulnerable.

## @VictorTaelin - Comprehensive analysis: Gemini 3 capabilities and limitations
> My notes on Gemini 3
>
> # Short Version:
>
> First of all: you've all seen the benchmarks, so I don't think you need me to judge this one. Still, based on my tests, this is as real as it gets, and I want to talk about it. This model outperforms GPT-5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, and everything else, on my hardest problems, by far.
>
> It is the new SOTA at:
> → debugging complex compiler bugs
> → refactoring files without logical mistakes
> → solving difficult λ-calculus problems
> → ASCII art (it is almost decent now!)
> → Competitive Gen 3 OU (won't elaborate 😭)
>
> It is still an LLM, though. It has similar failure modes, and is worse than Sonnet / GPT-5 in some scenarios.
>
> It seems very bad at:
> → inferring intent
> → not going overboard
> → one-shot vibe coding
> → creative writing
> → health questions
>
> Also, I suspect this checkpoint isn't the best Google has.
>
> Now, on to a complete, manually typed Gemini 3 overview.
>
> ---
>
> # Long Version
>
> 1. Vibe Test: λ-Calculus Programming
>
> I like this vibe test because it is cheat proof: as soon as a model solves my hardest problem, I just create a harder one, moving the goalpost a little bit.
>
> Current track record:
> → n-tuple-map: solved by Grok 3 (Feb 2025)
> → n-tuple-fold: solved by GPT-5 (Aug 2025)
> → n-tuple-rotl: solved by Gemini 3 (today!)
>
> Implementing rotl is impressive, because:
> → no other model gets even close to solving it
> → Gemini's solution is 2x simpler than my own's
> → Gemini 3 solved it 5x faster than myself
>
> In fact, its solution is so short, it fits a single line:
>
> λn.λt.λk.(tλx.(nλg.λh.(h(gλq.λr.λs.(q(r s))))λu.λf.(f x)λu.u k))
>
> Pretty, isn't it? This minuscule function is a generic rotator for λ-encoded tuples. For a comparison, every other model creates a 5x larger term... that doesn't work. Nothing else creates anything like that, at all. That answer was a jaw-dropping moment for me.
>
> I'll post a Gist with the prompt, and a runnable solution.
>
> 2. Real-World Debugging
>
> A few weeks ago, I was stuck in a tough HVM4 bug. I posted about it here, lamenting that no AI could solve it. Well, turns out, an AI did solve it. Someone managed to run my prompt on an old checkpoint via LMSys, and it nailed the issue: a stack underflow on a specific optimization. The solution was simple: replace `WNF_SPOS < 0` by `WNF_SPOS < spos`.
>
> This was the first time an AI solved a real problem before I could solve it myself, and that let me move on to the next thing, leading to great progress.
>
> I now tested Gemini 3 on many old debugging prompts, and it solved half of them. Bugs that took me hours are now solved by a computer in a minute!
>
> Now, and sadly: I've sent the stack underflow issue to the Gemini 3 model that launched today, and it failed to spot the culprit. So, either this model is not the smartest variant Google has, or I was really lucky that day. ):
>
> 3. Real-World Coding / Refactoring
>
> This model is great at writing large files with no mistakes.
>
> For example, I've asked some AIs to rewrite HVM4.hs with a few core changes. I then inspected the trickiest functions. As you'd expect, all models failed on important details that lead to serious bugs - except for Gemini 3, which nailed it.
>
> This is particularly encouraging to me, since models struggled with niche restrictions like linearity, making them unusable for core HVM functions. Gemini 3 seems extremely competent at it.
>
> (Code in the image below.)
>
> 4. Problems and Quirks
>
> I've asked Gemini 3 to one shot a web app, and it did poorly. GPT-5.1 (high) gave me complete file, with everything I asked for, zero bugs. Gemini 3 gave me a 3x smaller file, with tons of missing features and many bugs. I couldn't get Gemini 3 to one shot a file nearly as good as the one by GPT-5.1.
>
> I've also sent it my pre-meningitis prompt, and it completely discarded meningitis (💀). Not sure I'd trust it for health issues.
>
> I've asked it to write a story, and it was bad. No excuses.
>
> It will often go overboard and write full files instead of just patching holes.
>
> It seems slower than even GPT-5 (high) on Gemini CLI, although it is much faster when called directly?
>
> Lastly, and funnily, it struggles to produce incorrect code when context calls for it. For example, if your type has a generic "Show" instance, and you ask it to build a custom one, it will often struggle, because that'd technically be an error. It can't grasp that you'd just remove the old one afterwards!
>
> 5. Conclusion
>
> Enough typing, bye

## @mitsuhiko - AI discourse: Why JSON beats TOON for token efficiency
> AI discourse on Twitter is frustrating. Take this tweet with thousands of views. It claims you should  use TOON instead of JSON. But if you actually count tokens, the savings are … barely existing, it's not in the training data, and tabular JSON beats it. https://t.co/tD00NOS0mN https://t.co/vJe4zB407l

**Quote Context:** @DataChaz - Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON)
> If you're still sending raw JSON into your LLMs, you're burning tokens, latency, and budget!
>
> Try TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation).
>
> Clear like YAML, compact like CSV:
>
> • 30–60% fewer tokens
> • Up to 50% lower costs
> • Shines for tabular data.
>
> Free and Open source

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1990549149629222938

>
> This solves a fundamental problem of today's chat interfaces – They are good at single step request, but any multi-step action (like booking a flight or purchasing goods) quickly becomes a back and forth 'game of 10 questions'.
>
> While working on our own assistant, we realized the core driver of this problem is a human one: People don't know everything they need to say upfront, for every action you could do on the internet. And to solve it, we would need to think about how to marry design and technology in a new way.
>
> AI Autocomplete solves this, and can now plug into chat interfaces to guide you in real-time, with everything you would need to say, upfront. So you can do anything you can do on the internet in one shot. No more back and forth.
>
> As a result, this unlocks multiple AI breakthroughs:
> 1. 10x faster search and commerce
> 2. Smarter (and far lower cost) media generation
> 3. Natural language advertising
> 4. Powerful, lightweight Augmented Reality
>
> From here, we'll be using this for Hero, but we also want others to use it too since this is an industry-wide problem. So if you have a product that could benefit from AI Autocomplete and want to work with us, reach out below!

## @kieranklaassen - Token Efficiency in Agent Design with MCP
> Your agent connects to 50 MCP servers with 1,000 tools. It loads every tool definition into context before reading your request. Then it passes a 10,000-row spreadsheet through the model twice to copy data between tools.
>
> You just burned 150,000 tokens on overhead.
>
> Code execution with MCP solves this: agents write code to call tools, loading definitions on-demand and filtering data in the execution environment. Same task, 2,000 tokens—98.7% reduction.

> Maybe a tiny sobering moment we could stop and think about on the right – – right now, a candidate who wished for the death of not just his Republican opponents but also their children is leading in the Virginia AG race.
>
> And if he wins, we now have a precedent that you can call for the death of Republicans and still get elected. To me, that's pretty much the most important political story right now.

## @glcst - SQLite Database for AI Agent State Management
> Time and time again we hear from agent builders that they want a database that looks like a filesystem. Where they can store files locally, agent state, tool call state, and basic local observability.
>
> Obviously SQLite is the perfect shape for this. But a higher level of abstraction helps.
>
> I told Pekka not to worry about this now. Which of course means he just started hacking on it anyway, and as usual, it is looking very awesome!

**Quoted context:**
> @penberg: "SQLite is the perfect database for AI agents—but nobody knows how to use it. Many agent developers I've talked to make the same point: SQLite is ideal for capturing agent state, handling auditing, ensuring compliance, and managing snapshots. It's lightweight, all data represented in one single file. But when I ask them what the interface should look like, nobody can really answer. What should the schema look like? How do we make it work across different agent frameworks? How do we handle the filesystem transparently?
>
> After some iteration and conversations with folks building agents, I've identified the three missing pieces:
>
> 1. A standardized schema specification. We need a common way to represent agent state, actions, and outcomes. This isn't just about storing data—it's about enabling an ecosystem of tooling. When everyone uses the same schema, we can build debugging tools, replay systems, and compliance analyzers.
>
> 2. A programmatic SDK. Raw SQL obviously isn't enough. Developers need type-safe APIs, automatic migrations, and framework integrations. The SDK should feel native whether you're using a framework or rolling your own agent system.
>
> 3. A transparent filesystem layer. People building agent compute infrastructure actually want a transparent agent filesystem that works with bash, curl, and friends. Agents shouldn't have to think about where their data lives. They just read and write files, and our system handles the rest.
>
> That why me and @glcst at @tursodatabase have been hacking on AgentFS (https://t.co/qESfjwjC36)—a specification and implementation for agent state management. If you're building agents and fighting with state management, I'd love to hear from you. And if you want to help shape this standard, check out the repo and join the discussion."

- **What:** Discussion on SQLite's suitability for AI agent state management and the development of AgentFS as a standardized solution with schema specifications and SDK.

## @dystopiangf - Immigration and Societal Decline
> One of many problems with mass 3rd world immigration: your country in decline & decay is still a massive improvement over their home countries. They don't even perceive the decline. They'll think "this is as good as it gets" the whole way down, which is terrifying to witness

## @QwQiao - Coinbase's strategy to become a banking platform
> i might be a bit late to realize this, but after being a "coinbase one" customer and their amex card i kinda get where coinbase is going long term — they want to become a bank.

> ive already switched from other credit cards to the coinbase amex card cuz its nice to get 4% cashback in btc. i also get a big discount on my trading fees. but to get these benefits i need to pay an annual fee and lock in $200k. this is akin to amazon prime and costco black card, creating enormous customer loyalty. later they'll probably bundle it with other financial products like stock trading.
